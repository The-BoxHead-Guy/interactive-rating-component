## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

### What I learned

I learned how to use `@container` as a way of making changes in the CSS by setting a container query instead of depending only on media queries

`forEach` iteration was also a good method to access to each element of the component and its change of state

The use of `setTimeout` function and understanding better how callback functions work in these cases in order to make smooth animation after triggering the buttons conformed something useful 

### Useful resources

Almost all the aditional resources where found in **MDN** as it's the place where there are so much documentation about the elements used in this project.
